  Cross-cutting state of mrcall-desktop — things that span engine ↔ app
  or the repo as a whole (JSON-RPC contract drift, release pipeline,
  brand/rename rollout, monorepo conventions). Engine-only state lives

# Active Context — Cross-cutting

## Current focus (as of 2026-05-28)

**Post-signup onboarding hub on the Update view.** Spans engine + app + IPC. The contract gains two new RPCs: `sync.run({days_back?})` (data-fetch only — IMAP email + WhatsApp, emits `sync.progress`, `humanize_error`-enveloped result) and `setup.state()` (read-only `{has_synced, has_trained, emails_count, whatsapp_messages_count, agents_trained}`). The app exposes them as a three-card flow in `views/Update.tsx` (Sync → Train → Update, gated on `has_synced` / `has_trained`); default view after the splash is now `'update'`. Engine-side, the trainers' sync LLM calls were starving the asyncio loop during `agents.train_all`, leaking as `rpc timeout: whatsapp.status` in the renderer — `_generate_prompt` is now `async` and awaits `LLMClient.create_message` (the existing `run_in_executor` wrapper). Live-verify pending across all of: 3-card gating, default-view change, asyncio-loop fairness during Train.

**MrCall channel — Livello A (customer-service lookup) landed; Livello B (phone-call memory) is next.** Spans engine + app + IPC. The legacy delegated/PKCE OAuth2 auth + the `/mrcall` command surface are removed — StarChat is reached via the Firebase JWT only. The MrCall tab lists + searches businesses (`mrcall.list_my_businesses`, `mrcall.search_businesses`, role-scoped by StarChat: admin cross-owner, owner own-only). Onboarding unblocked for MrCall-only users + an in-wizard Calendar session fix landed. Live-verified by Mario 2026-05-20. **Hard constraint for Livello B**: never ingest into memory the contacts/conversations of businesses the logged-in uid doesn't own — StarChat's `FirebaseCustomerConversationService` already hard-scopes conversation search to the caller's uid; a defence-in-depth filter is still planned engine-side. Plan: [mrcall-pipeline-parity.md](execution-plans/mrcall-pipeline-parity.md). **This work lives on `worktree-sprightly-floating-anchor`, merged up to main, pending promotion to `main`.**

WhatsApp parity spans engine + app + IPC through Phase 4 cross-channel (live-verified 2026-05-19). Residual live verification: Update staged progress, Calendar self-healing, MrCall-credits v1 round-trip (pending `mrcall-agent` at `https://zylch-test.mrcall.ai`). Release pipeline still has open hardening items in [`harness-backlog.md`](harness-backlog.md) (workflow doesn't fail when one arch's installer is missing).

## Recent landings (last ~2 weeks)

| Date | What | Spans | Refs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-27 | Onboarding hub on the Update view (3 ordered cards Sync → Train → Update with `setup.state` gating + Quick-start banner; default view `'update'` after the splash). New RPCs `sync.run` (email + WA fetch only, `sync.progress` stream) and `setup.state` (per-profile snapshot). Engine: trainers no longer monopolise the asyncio loop during `agents.train_all` — fixes the `rpc timeout: whatsapp.status` Mario hit. New `services/process_pipeline.run_sync_only` exposed for the `sync.run` RPC. See [`ipc-contract.md`](ipc-contract.md) §`sync.run` + §`setup.state`. Live-verify pending. | engine + app + IPC | uncommitted |
| 2026-05-26 | WhatsApp tab gains send (`whatsapp.send_message`) + search (`whatsapp.search_messages`); solve attachment fix (uses RFC822 Message-ID header + multi-folder IMAP search — Aleide invoices download for real); Onboarding + engine `_resolve_host` default unknown email domains to Google (no more `imap.<domain>` NXDOMAIN); memory: new namespace `template:<owner>` for behavioral rules + `entry_type` structural guard so feedback can't land on a contact blob; Update view surfaces structured errors via `humanize_error` (no more false "Update complete" on a failed sync) | engine + app + IPC | `ca784d0d..4e243bdb` merged via `436bb291` (2026-05-27) |
| 2026-05-26 | "Train assistant" button above Update — new RPC `agents.train_all` runs memory_message + task_email + emailer serially with `agents.train.progress` notifications; `MessageMemoryAgentTrainer` now ingests WhatsApp 1-on-1 chats (where user has replied) in addition to email samples | engine + app + IPC | `3c152cc7` |
| 2026-05-22 | Current datetime injected into EVERY LLM request (single LLMClient chokepoint + chat_compaction bypass) — fixes task-detection guessing the date; cache-safe append after cache_control blocks | engine | `5f5c73e8` |
| 2026-05-20 | MrCall channel: delegated/PKCE OAuth + `/mrcall` commands removed (Firebase-JWT only); MrCall tab lists + searches businesses (`mrcall.list_my_businesses`, `mrcall.search_businesses`); onboarding unblocked for MrCall-only users + in-wizard Calendar session fix; 13 stale tests removed | engine + app + IPC | `770522e8..2b0a54ce` · [mrcall-pipeline-parity.md](execution-plans/mrcall-pipeline-parity.md) |
| 2026-05-20 | WhatsApp voice-note transcription — engine downloads ogg/opus at event time + deferred on-device faster-whisper `small`/int8 pass; `transcription` field on `whatsapp.list_messages`; UI renders transcript (🎤 + "vocale trascritta" hint, `[vocale]` pending). + revoke (delete-for-everyone purges target locally) + archived chats excluded from memory/task analysis (UI unaffected). Dev-verified only; live download + packaged bundling pending | engine + app + IPC | [`../engine/docs/execution-plans/whatsapp-voice-transcription.md`](../engine/docs/execution-plans/whatsapp-voice-transcription.md) |
| 2026-05-15 | Cross-channel Source-panel toggle — engine stamps `sources.whatsapp_chat_jid`; ThreadPanel renders Email/WhatsApp tab pills with counters, parallel fetch, instant tab switch | engine + app + IPC | `b57fcc4f` |
| 2026-05-15 | Calendar self-healing Firebase session — `ensureEngineSession()` re-pushes token + verifies via `account.whoAmI()` before Calendar RPCs; initial token push retries 3× with backoff | engine + app | `a03f6831` · `1c60aebf` |
| 2026-05-15 | Update view staged progress emissions + ETA rewrite + elapsed timer (engine progress callback, renderer 1 s ticker + overshot hint) | engine + app | `0b33fdf4` · `cb91901b` |
| 2026-05-15 | WhatsApp source panel in Workspace (Fase 4a + 4b) — `ThreadSourceType` widened to `'email' \| 'whatsapp'`; WA branch renders bubbles via `whatsapp.listMessages` | app | `2a8bc2c3` |

## In progress

- End-to-end live verification of Firebase signin paths (email/password, Continue with Google) in `npm run dev` and in packaged DMG/EXE.
- `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_SECRET` repo secret creation at *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*. Until done, packaged builds with Google signin will fail at the materialise step.
- Mac validation of MrCall-credits v1 round-trip — needs the proxy deployed at the test URL.
- Mac validation of Update staged progress and Calendar self-healing.

## Next steps

1. Wire `humanize_error` into the remaining RPC surfaces that still raise raw `httpx`/`imaplib` tracebacks (`rpc/account.py:account.balance`, Settings test-connection, chat tools, solve tools) — classifier ready, only `update.run` consumes it today.
3. Live-test signin paths in `npm run dev` — IdentityBanner correct, `auth:bindProfile` attaches sidecar or routes to Onboarding.
4. Add `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_SECRET` repo secret so the next `v*` tag push produces a working packaged build.
5. Configure `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID` in profile Settings → "Connect Google Calendar" → confirm consent + token persistence + self-healing recovery path.
6. Wire `engine/zylch/tools/calendar_sync.py` to the new `provider='google_calendar'` tokens.
7. Open **MrCall pipeline parity** workstream — memory extraction → task creation → UI tab → cross-channel toggle. Plan in [execution-plans/mrcall-pipeline-parity.md](execution-plans/mrcall-pipeline-parity.md); Phase 0 needs Mario's sample `mrcall_conversations.body` + answers to 6 design questions before Phase 1.

## Known issues

- **No live end-to-end verification of any Firebase signin path.**
- **MrCall-credits v1 not live-verified.**
- **No automated contract test for IPC method/payload changes** — tracked in [`harness-backlog.md`](harness-backlog.md). TypeScript catches signature mismatches inside the renderer but not engine↔preload divergence.
- **No CI for `engine/make lint` and `app/npm run typecheck`** — tracked in [`harness-backlog.md`](harness-backlog.md).
- **No CI for `pytest` on engine** — tracked in [`harness-backlog.md`](harness-backlog.md).
- **No E2E test for multi-window Firebase auth flows** — tracked in [`harness-backlog.md`](harness-backlog.md).
- **Release workflow doesn't fail when one arch's installer is missing** — Win-x64 break across v0.1.31..v0.1.32 silent for a week; tracked in [`harness-backlog.md`](harness-backlog.md).
- **No CI gate prevents committing the OAuth Client secret (`GOCSPX-`)** — tracked in [`harness-backlog.md`](harness-backlog.md).
