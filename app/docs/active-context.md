# Active Context — App

## Current focus (as of 2026-05-27)

**MrCall tab + onboarding/Calendar fixes (live-verified by Mario 2026-05-20).** The MrCall tab is live (was a disabled placeholder): `views/Mrcall.tsx` lists the user's businesses via `mrcall.list_my_businesses` (Firebase JWT — same endpoint the dashboard uses) and, for customer-service lookup, searches by field (email / name / phone / VAT) + a `subscriptionStatus` dropdown via `mrcall.search_businesses`, with expandable anagraphic/billing cards. Onboarding no longer forces email/IMAP — a signed-in Firebase user can enter straight away; the form hides the LLM / Telegram / MrCall groups (`ProfileFormFields includeGroups`); the Email tab is now gated on a real `IMAP_HOST`, not `EMAIL_ADDRESS` (always the Firebase email). Calendar "engine isn't seeing your Firebase session" fixed: `installEngineTokenPusher()` runs right after onboarding `finalize` (the token pusher was left unset during onboarding, so the in-wizard Calendar connect ran session-less).

Residual: live verification of the 2026-05-15 stack (cross-channel `ThreadPanel`, Update staged progress, Calendar self-healing) + every Firebase signin path from a fresh state.

## Recent landings (last ~2 weeks)

| Date | What | Refs |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-26 | `views/WhatsApp.tsx`: composer at the bottom of the reading pane (Enter=send, Shift+Enter=newline, optimistic append + scroll-to-bottom) + search bar atop the thread list (Enter=search, Esc=clear); `match_snippet` rendered on search hits. `views/Update.tsx` renders `result.errors[]` as red (fatal) / amber (warning) blocks with title + detail + action — replaces the false-green "No changes" on a failed sync. `views/Onboarding.tsx` `inferHosts` defaults unknown email domains to `imap.gmail.com`/`smtp.gmail.com` instead of `imap.<domain>` (was always NXDOMAIN for non-preset domains, e.g. `@mrcall.ai`). New preload bindings `whatsapp.sendMessage` + `whatsapp.searchMessages`. | `ca784d0d..4e243bdb` merged via `436bb291` (2026-05-27) |
| 2026-05-26 | "Train assistant" card above Update — `views/Update.tsx` renders a Train-now button + progress bar + per-agent result row that drives `window.zylch.agents.trainAll()`. Subscribes to `agents.train.progress` for the bar; 30-min preload timeout. Each card disables the other while running. | `3c152cc7` |
| 2026-05-20 | MrCall tab live (was disabled placeholder) — `views/Mrcall.tsx`: business list via `mrcall.list_my_businesses` + search-by-field (email/name/phone/VAT) + `subscriptionStatus` dropdown via `mrcall.search_businesses`, expandable anagraphic/billing cards | `ed9ca585` · `a28c5533` |
| 2026-05-20 | Onboarding unblocked for MrCall-only users (email opt-in, `ProfileFormFields includeGroups` hides LLM/Telegram/MrCall) + Calendar session fix (`installEngineTokenPusher` after `finalize`) + Email tab gated on `IMAP_HOST` not `EMAIL_ADDRESS` | `2b0a54ce` |
| 2026-05-20 | WhatsApp voice-note transcripts in the Source panel — `transcription` field added to the WhatsAppMessage type (from `whatsapp.list_messages`); `ThreadPanel.tsx` + `views/WhatsApp.tsx` render the transcript with a 🎤 marker + "vocale trascritta" hint, `[vocale]` placeholder while not yet transcribed | [`../../engine/docs/execution-plans/whatsapp-voice-transcription.md`](../../engine/docs/execution-plans/whatsapp-voice-transcription.md) |
| 2026-05-15 | Cross-channel Source-panel toggle — `ZylchTask.sources.whatsapp_chat_jid?`, `Conversation.waChatJid?`, `ThreadPanel` API `{ emailThreadId?, whatsappChatJid? }` with three modes (email-only / whatsapp-only / cross-channel); cross-channel header shows `Email (N) / WhatsApp (M)` tab pills with counters + parallel fetch + instant tab switch | `b57fcc4f` |
| 2026-05-15 | Calendar self-healing UI — `ConnectGoogleCalendar.tsx` gains `ensureEngineSession()` + `signin-required` phase with Retry button; `App.tsx` initial token push retries 3× with backoff | `a03f6831` |
| 2026-05-15 | Update view elapsed timer (1 s ticker, "· elapsed 1m23s") + overshot hint ("Running longer than the initial estimate") | `0b33fdf4` |
| 2026-05-15 | WhatsApp source panel (Fase 4a + 4b) — `ThreadSourceType` widened to `'email' \| 'whatsapp'`; WA branch via `whatsapp.listMessages({ chat_jid, limit: 200 })`, bubble alignment by `is_from_me`, header shows resolved phone for `@s.whatsapp.net` jids | `2a8bc2c3` |
| 2026-05-12 | Agentic task "Open" — `openTaskChat` fires `tasks.solve` directly, `Conversation.threadId` + `taskCompleted` carried in store, Source-panel persistence with mount-time backfill for legacy convs, contextual header button (Riapri ↔ Marca come fatta), Annulla calls `tasks.solve.cancel` (not approve(false)), ApprovalCard mode-aware | `df1e1fb1..b36e15b3` |
| 2026-05-12 | Pre-Firebase legacy code removed (`inMemoryPersistence`, every window through Firebase, `?legacy=1` + `ZYLCH_PROFILE` bypasses deleted, `NewProfileWizard.tsx` deleted, -558 lines) | `c43ff35e` |
| 2026-05-11 | Profile picker shows email instead of raw Firebase UID — `profile:current` / `profiles:list` return `{id, email}` | — |

## In progress

- Click-test every signin path in `npm run dev`.
- Click-test on a packaged DMG/EXE (blocked on `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_SECRET` repo secret).
- Mac validation of cross-channel task UI (needs a real cross-channel task).
- Mac validation of Update staged progress emissions.
- Mac validation of Calendar self-healing recovery path.
- Mac validation of pre-existing UI flows (close-note composer, IMAP archive, Open → Tasks filter, end-to-end memory tool round-trip in chat).

## Next steps

1. `cd app && npm run dev` → exercise Continue with Google + email/password → IdentityBanner correct → `auth:bindProfile` attaches sidecar or routes to Onboarding.
2. Trigger `/update` in the dev build → confirm progress emissions at 5/20/30/60/80-90/95/100 and the elapsed timer ticks.
3. Settings → "Connect Google Calendar" on a session where the initial token push was missed → confirm the recovery path closes the loop (no raw `_NotSignedInError`).
4. Produce a cross-channel task (synthetic SQL or fresh Update) → confirm the Email/WhatsApp toggle in `ThreadPanel` renders both tabs with correct counters.
5. Add `GOOGLE_SIGNIN_CLIENT_SECRET` repo secret at *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*.

## Known issues

- **WhatsApp send + search not live-verified** — typecheck passes; engine-side test against a real temp DB passes (12 tests); the actual send to a real recipient + search rendering needs Mario QA with a connected WhatsApp.
- **Update error blocks not live-verified visually** — engine returns the structured `errors[]` correctly (proven end-to-end via the real RPC with a bogus host); the red/amber render path needs eyes-on in the app.
- **No live end-to-end verification of any Firebase signin path** from this machine.
- **MrCall-credits v1 not live-verified.**
- **Cross-channel `ThreadPanel` mode not exercised** on a real task.
- **Update staged progress and Calendar self-healing not live-verified.**
- **Onboarding-mode invariants not stress-tested** on a fresh Mac with empty `~/.zylch/profiles/`.
- `tasks.complete` / `tasks.skip` / `tasks.reopen` have no `*.changed` notification — other windows on the same profile won't update their task list until manual refresh.
- No unit test coverage on the renderer side. IPC contract is the only enforcement; payload-shape mismatches surface only at runtime.
